Callback function to format the text of the tooltip from scratch. Return `false` to disable tooltip for a specific point on series. A subset of HTML is supported.

The following tags are supported: `<b>`, `<strong>`, `<i>`, `<em>`, `<br/>`, `<span>`. Spans can be styled with a `style` attribute, but only text-related CSS that is shared with SVG is handled. Since version 2.1 the tooltip can be shared between multiple series through the `shared` option. The available data in the formatter differ a bit depending on whether the tooltip is shared or not. In a shared tooltip, all properties except `x`, which is common for all points, are kept in an array, `this.points`. Available data are:  this.percentage (not shared) / this.points[i].percentage (shared)  Stacked series and pies only. The point's percentage of the total.  this.point (not shared) / this.points[i].point (shared) The point object. The point name, if defined, is available through `this.point.name`. this.points In a shared tooltip, this is an array containing all other properties for each point. this.series (not shared) / this.points[i].series (shared) The series object.
