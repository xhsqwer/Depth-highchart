/**
A color axis for choropleth maps and heat maps. Visually, the color axis will appear as a gradient or as separate items inside the legend, depending on whether the axis is scalar or based on data classes. For supported color formats, see the [docs article about colors](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-design-and-style/colors). A scalar color axis is represented by a gradient. The colors either range between the `minColor` and the `maxColor`, or for more fine grained control the colors can be defined in `stops`. Often times, the color axis needs to be adjusted to get the right color spread for the data. In addition to stops, consider using a logarithmic `axis type`, or setting `min` and `max` to avoid the colors being determined by outliers. When `dataClasses` are used, the ranges are subdivided into separate classes like categories based on their values. This can be used for ranges between two values, but also for a true category. However, when your data is categorized, it may be as convenient to add each category to a separate series. See `the Axis object` for programmatic access to the axis.
