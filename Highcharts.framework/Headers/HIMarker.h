Options for the point markers of line-like series. Properties like `fillColor`, `lineColor` and `lineWidth` define the visual appearance of the markers. Other series types, like column series, don't have markers, but have visual options on the series level instead. In styled mode, the markers can be styled with the `.highcharts-point`, `.highcharts-point-hover` and `.highcharts-point-select` class names.

Custom callbacks for symbol path generation can also be added to `Highcharts.SVGRenderer.prototype.symbols`. The callback is then used by its method name, as shown in the demo.
