/**
Options for the Boost module. The Boost module allows certain series types to be rendered by WebGL instead of the default SVG. This allows hundreds of thousands of data points to be rendered in milliseconds. In addition to the WebGL rendering it saves time by skipping processing and inspection of the data wherever possible. This introduces some limitations to what features are available in Boost mode. See [the docs](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/advanced-chart-features/boost-module) for details. In addition to the global `boost` option, each series has a `boostThreshold` that defines when the boost should kick in. Requires the `modules/boost.js` module.
